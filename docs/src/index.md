# WiNDCHousehold

This is a disaggregation of the [WiNDCRegional](https://github.com/uw-windc/WiNDCRegional.jl) dataset to include household-level detail. 

This package is under active development. For quick start instructions, see the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

This disaggregation is currently limited to 2024. We plan to expand to the years 1997-2024 soon.
